* application_carpool
A program for keeping all your applications alive in the background, similar to PM2.

** Requirements
For building and running, Java 21+ is required. Other than that, you don't need anything else.

** Usage
This describes the general usage of Carpool.
For brevity, =jar= will be used instead of =java -jar <jarfile>=

*** Supervisor Daemon Management
_Starting and stopping_
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports code
jar -start
jar -stop

# NOTE: if the -log_level flag is used
# with -start, the log level will be
# set for the supervisor daemon as well
jar -log_level=FINE -start
#+END_SRC

_Status_
src_sh[:exports code]{jar -status}

*** Service Management
*NOTE:* the daemon must be started to use these

_Adding and removing_
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports code
jar -add_service="./some-executable --args"
jar -remove_service=<pid>
#+END_SRC

_Listing_
src_sh[:exports code]{jar -list_services}

** Building and contributing
IntelliJ IDEA is recommended, but use what works for you.
Gradle is used for building -- use the build task to compile and the jar task to make a JAR.
